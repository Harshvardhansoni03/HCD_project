## Overview

The **IoT Water Tank Level Controller** is a high-tech solution for automating water level monitoring and pump control in residential settings. Built using the **STM32 microcontroller**, **ultrasonic sensors**, and the **LoRa RA-01** module, the system ensures **real-time**, **long-range**, and **low-power** communication between the underground and terrace water tanks.

This project aims to solve everyday water management issues like:

* Manual tank level checking
* Water overflow and wastage
* Pump dry run damage
* Unnecessary electricity consumption

## Features

* ✅ **Real-time water level monitoring**
* 🔁 **Automated pump control**
* 📡 **LoRa RA-01 communication (up to 10km range)**
* ⚡ **STM32 microcontroller for fast and efficient processing**
* 🌞 **Solar-powered option for energy efficiency**
* 🧠 **Human-centered design for ease of use**
* 💡 **Modular architecture for scalability and maintenance**

## Technologies Used

| Component                         | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **STM32 MCU**                     | Handles sensor data, logic, and control operations      |
| **Ultrasonic Sensors**            | Measures water levels in underground and overhead tanks |
| **LoRa RA-01 Module**             | Enables long-range, low-power wireless communication    |
| **Relay Module**                  | Controls pump ON/OFF based on level data                |
| **Solar Panel (optional)**        | Powers system sustainably in off-grid areas             |
| **OLED Display / LED indicators** | For real-time user feedback (optional UI)               |

## Advantages of LoRa RA-01

* 📶 **Ultra-long range communication (up to 10 km in rural areas)**
* 🔋 **Low power consumption — ideal for solar setups**
* 📡 **High interference immunity for reliable data transmission**
* 🧩 **Easy integration with STM32 and other MCUs**

## How It Works

1. **Water Level Detection:** Ultrasonic sensors measure the water level in both tanks.
2. **Data Transmission:** Sensor data is sent wirelessly via **LoRa RA-01**.
3. **Decision Logic:** STM32 processes incoming data and decides whether to start or stop the pump.
4. **Pump Control:** Relay is triggered to operate the pump automatically.
5. **User Feedback:** Optional OLED display or LEDs show current system status.

## 🧪 Use Cases

* 🏠 Residential water tank automation
* 🏢 Apartment and building water management
* 🌾 Smart irrigation systems in agriculture
* 🛖 Remote rural homes with limited access
